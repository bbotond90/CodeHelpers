# CodeHelpers
Helper methods for different languages

I have to write examples for the new APIs, but at this moment I think these libraries are really intuitive already.

For JavaScript

There is a logger that you can disable on any level, and you can have multiple instances of it.

And there is a C# kind of Linq.Where in 2 versions. One of them returns a list of index, the other one returns a list of matched item.

More is coming.

-------------------
Separate JS and C# into its own Git Repo
Merge the JS array to bring back all the indexes AND the objects itself in one query. Could save a lot of dev time for the user.
