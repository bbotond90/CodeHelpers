# CodeHelpers
Helper methods for different languages

I have to write examples for the new APIs, but at this moment I think these libraries are really intuitive already.

For JavaScript
There is a logger that you can disable on any level, and there is a C# kind of Linq.Where in 2 versions. One of them is returns a list of index, the other one returns a list of matched item.

More is coming.
